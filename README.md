# Task-5
Purpose of training vs testing.
The purpose of training a model on a dataset is to make the model learn the patterns and find mathematical relationship between the features in the dataset which will enable it to make predictions.
The purpose of testing is to make sure the model is trained properly and gives accurate outcome for unseen data.
The confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of the classification model. It shows where the model was right and where it was confused. It thas four quadrants 1.True Positive 2.True Negative 3.False Positive 4.False Negative
The model is 78% accurate ,meaning the model is correct 78 times out of 100 times.
The model is 74% precise ,meaning when the model predicts heart disease it is correct 74 out of 100 times.
The model's recall is 87%, meaning out of all people who actually have heart disease, the model found 87 out of 100 of them. which means it did not find 13% of the people with heart disease.
